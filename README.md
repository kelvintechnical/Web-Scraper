# Kid Heart Repository

## Overview
The Kid Heart repository is a web scraping project aimed at extracting book titles and prices from the [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/) website. The project leverages Python's `requests` library to fetch HTML content and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing and navigating the HTML structure. The extracted data is then saved into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Lessons Learned
While building this project, I gained valuable experience and insights, particularly in the following areas:
1. **Web Scraping Techniques**: Mastered the use of `requests` to send HTTP GET requests and fetch webpage content. Utilized `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML, extracting specific data points like book titles and prices, and understanding the importance of checking HTTP response status codes for successful data retrieval.
2. **Data Handling and Storage**: Developed skills in handling and storing data by creating and managing CSV files using Python's `csv` module. Learned to structure data in a meaningful way for analysis and sharing.
3. **Error Handling and Debugging**: Enhanced my ability to troubleshoot and debug issues by implementing error handling mechanisms. Understood the significance of response status codes in diagnosing potential problems with web requests.
